A Railway Power System Scenario Simulation tool based on Monte Carlo Analysis
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This repository comprises two MATLAB classes: **MONTE_CARLO.m** and **electric_model.m** capable of snapshot simulation of a railway line.
The implemented framework depends on MATPOWER for power flow solver.


### Current Development Version
There are two options:
1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Download a ZIP file of the repository from GitHub.


### System Requirements
*   MATLAB version 9.4 (R2018a) or later
*   (older versions might not be compatible with the GUI)
*   Statistics toolbox
*   Parallelism toolbox

------------
### Instalation
Installation and use of this framework requires familiarity with the basic
operation of MATLAB or Octave.
1. The instalation only requires download of the repository.


### Usage
The simplest way to run the framework is to use the GUI. 
1. Open the matlab with the workspace in the cloned repository;
2. Open the file **GUI_montecarlo.mlapp**
3. This GUI is the main handler for the **MONTE_CARLO.m** and **electric_model.m** classes.
